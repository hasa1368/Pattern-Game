# Pattern-Game
The QML game is a pattern-matching challenge where players must touch cells in a specific sequence to recreate a snake-like pattern on a grid (600x800, 50x50 cells). Each round, a random, winding snake pattern (5â€“10 cells) appears, fades out after 1 second, and players have 3 seconds to touch the cells in order. Correct touches highlight cells green (#22c55e, scaled up); incorrect touches reset highlights. The game has 10 stages, each with 10 rounds. Scoring 10 points per correct sequence, players need >50 points to advance. AI hints flash cells to guide players, and the game features vibrant gradients, particle effects, and UI elements (Arial, outlined text, centered buttons). Completing Stage 10 triggers a victory window with confetti effects.
